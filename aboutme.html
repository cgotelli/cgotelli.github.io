      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am Clemente Gotelli, a hydraulic engineer and PhD in Mechanics from EPFL in Switzerland. My background spans hydraulic engineering and water resources, supported by professional experience in hydraulic design, flood modeling, and hydrology. During my doctoral research, I focused on experimental investigations of braided rivers. I also have a solid foundation in numerical modeling, using both 2D and 3D frameworks to analyze river processes and sediment dynamics.</p>
      <p>I am currently based in Switzerland, where I continue to develop projects and pursue research in environmental hydraulics. This website brings together my technical work and personal reflections, driven by curiosity and a commitment to understanding and communicating how natural systems function.</p>
