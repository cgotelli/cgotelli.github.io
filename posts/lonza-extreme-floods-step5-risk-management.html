        <h3>From numbers to decisions</h3>
        <p>
          For a temporary lake behind a rock–ice dam, engineers are interested not only in the peak discharge, but also in the <strong>flood volume</strong> that can be stored or released without unacceptable risk. The combined analysis provides both:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>design peak flow \(Q_{100}\)</strong> for sizing spillways or estimating potential breach hydrographs.</li>
          <li>An estimate of the <strong>event volume</strong>, by integrating the modeled hydrograph over the event duration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With these elements, we can run simplified dam‑break scenarios, assess downstream inundation with 1D or 2D hydraulic models, and discuss acceptable safety margins with decision‑makers.

        <h3>Broader lessons</h3>
        <p>
          Although this example is tied to a specific alpine basin, the workflow is generic. Any hydraulic engineer working on mountain rivers, debris‑flow‑prone catchments, or small headwater basins will face similar constraints: short records, strong seasonality, and high stakes for rare events. Being able to assemble a consistent picture from discharge data, precipitation records, and simple models is a core skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          In future posts, I plan to share code snippets and plots from the Python implementation (data handling, extreme value fits, and rainfall–runoff simulations) to make this approach fully reproducible and easy to adapt to other catchments.</p>
