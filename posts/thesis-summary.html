        Braided rivers appear chaotic at first sight, but their complexity hides repeating patterns. In my doctoral
        thesis, I developed a method that discovers these patterns from images and uses them to build probabilistic
        forecasts of sediment transport. The goal is to show that river form can be translated into a language of
        states, and that this language can be used to generate reliable, data driven predictions.
      </p>

      <p><strong>By Clemente Gotelli</strong></p>

      <p>
        Braided rivers change continuously. Even with constant water and sediment supply, they reorganize their channels
        as bars migrate, bifurcations open or close, and new flow paths form. This reworking produces intense
        variability in sediment transport and makes these rivers difficult to predict with standard deterministic
        models.
      </p>

      <p>
        My thesis introduces a new approach based on two ideas. First, the river does not explore an infinite range of
        shapes. Instead, it cycles through a limited set of recurrent morphological states. Second, the transitions
        among these states can be described with a continuous time Markov chain. Once the states are known, and once
        their transition probabilities are estimated, the Markov model becomes a generator capable of simulating many
        possible futures for the river. From these synthetic futures, we can derive probabilistic forecasts of sediment
        flux that incorporate uncertainty directly.

        <h3>A laboratory river observed minute by minute</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset comes from a long duration experiment in a 3.3 meter by 1 meter flume filled with uniform sand.
          Steady discharge and sediment supply created a self sustaining braided pattern that evolved freely for nearly
          1,200 hours. A camera captured one image every minute, and a load cell recorded the downstream sediment flux
          in real time.

          study.</div>
        <p>
          The resulting time series shows the type of intermittency that motivates a probabilistic view. Long periods of
          low activity alternate with sharp spikes in transport. Even over hundreds of hours, the cumulative flux does
          not settle to a simple trend.

        <h3>Converting images into a set of morphological states</h3>
        <p>
          Each photograph is processed to highlight the wetted area of the channel. A color filter isolates the dyed
          water and produces a clean binary mask that separates water from dry bed. A one pixel water outline is then
          extracted to represent the planform shape in a consistent and stable way.

        <p>
          To compare two river configurations, the method uses a combination of the Modified Hausdorff Distance and the
          Dice index. These two distances are combined into a single matrix and projected into a low dimensional morpho
          space through dimensionality reduction. Clustering in this space reveals that the river cycles through exactly
          sixteen recurrent morphological states. These include narrow channels, transitional structures, and wide multi
          thread patterns rich in bars.

        <h3>What these states reveal about sediment transport</h3>
        <p>
          Because each image has a corresponding measurement of bedload, we can estimate the typical transport rate
          within each state. The result is consistent across the entire dataset. Narrow states export sediment more
          efficiently and with higher variability. Wide braided states tend to store sediment and produce lower and
          steadier fluxes. This confirms that morphology contains predictive information about transport.

        <h3>A Markov chain for state transitions</h3>
        <p>
          Once every minute of the experiment has a state label, the river can be viewed as a sequence of state visits.
          Some states persist for long periods while others act as brief intermediates during reorganizations. This
          behavior can be represented by a continuous time Markov chain in which each state has a characteristic dwell
          time and a distribution of possible next states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition matrix shows that bar rich states are stable and long lived. In contrast, simple narrow states
          are short lived but crucial for routing sediment out of the system. The same pattern appears in two shorter
          independent runs, which validates the robustness of the state definitions and transition structure.

        <h3>Monte Carlo as the engine of probabilistic forecasting</h3>
        <p>
          The most important part of the framework is the Monte Carlo generator. Once the Markov chain is calibrated, we
          simulate a very large number of synthetic futures. Each simulation is a possible trajectory of state
          transitions that respects the observed transition probabilities and dwell time distributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These synthetic trajectories form the backbone of the forecast. For every simulated sequence of states, we
          reconstruct a sediment transport time series by sampling from the empirical distribution of each state. This
          two layer Monte Carlo process produces a large ensemble of transport signals. From this ensemble, we can
          compute confidence intervals, return levels, and the distribution of possible future bursts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The synthetic series reproduce the real experiment remarkably well. They capture the mean, the variance, the
          timing structure of bursts, and the scaling of variability across time scales. They also highlight a small
          mismatch at very low frequencies, which identifies a clear direction for future improvement using semi Markov
          models.

        <h3>Why this method represents a new direction</h3>
        <p>
          The thesis presents the first complete pipeline that begins with planview images, identifies recurrent
          morphological states, models their temporal evolution with a continuous time Markov chain, generates synthetic
          futures with a Monte Carlo engine, and reconstructs probabilistic forecasts of sediment transport.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach fills a gap between descriptive metrics that cannot predict future behavior and detailed physics
          based models that are difficult to use for uncertainty quantification. The method is transparent and
          computationally light. It can be applied to any imagery based dataset, including satellite and drone
          observations, making it useful for regions where transport measurements are unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, the results suggest that braided rivers do not behave randomly. They follow a structure
          defined by a small number of morphological states and by the probabilities of transitioning among them. This
          discovery opens new possibilities for understanding how form relates to function and for developing
          probabilistic theories of river dynamics.
