      <p class="lead">How a Markov Chain approach and clustering turned a chaotic braided river into a readable language of states—connecting form to function and forecasting sediment pulses.</p>

      <!-- <p><strong>By Clemente Gotelli</strong></p> -->
      <p>Braided rivers are among the most complex landscapes on Earth. If you look at a river like the Navisence in Switzerland or the braided reaches of the Himalayas, you don’t see a simple channel. You see a restless network of water threads that constantly split, rejoin, erode banks, and build islands.</p>
      <p>For scientists and engineers, these rivers are notoriously difficult to predict. They are chaotic and “bursty”—a river might be quiet for hours and then, without any change in water volume, suddenly release a massive pulse of sediment. Traditional physics-based models struggle to capture this unpredictability without becoming impossibly slow to run.</p>
      <p>In my PhD thesis, <strong>“Morphodynamic Evolution of Braided Rivers: A Markov Chain Approach,”</strong> I proposed a different path. Instead of trying to simulate every grain of sand with complex physics, I asked a simpler question: <strong>Can we predict what a river will do just by looking at its shape?</strong></p>
      <p>Here is how we used Artificial Intelligence and probability to turn the chaos of a braided river into a readable, predictable language.</p>

      <div class="section-block">
        <h3>The Problem: Rivers Have “Mood Swings”</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest headaches in river management is that sediment transport is highly intermittent. You can have steady water flow, but sediment moves in unpredictable bursts. This makes it hard to manage flood risks or design infrastructure.</p>
        <p>To study this, we created a “lab-sized river.” We ran an experiment in a flume for <strong>1,200 continuous hours</strong>—a massive dataset that allowed us to watch the river evolve over time scales that are impossible to capture in the field. We took a photo every minute and measured the sediment output constantly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-block">
        <h3>The Alphabet of the River</h3>
        <p>We hypothesized that the river isn't infinitely random. Instead, it cycles through a finite set of “morphological states”—distinct shapes that repeat over time.</p>
        <p>Using machine learning algorithms (clustering), we analyzed thousands of images and discovered that the river’s complex behavior could be boiled down to <strong>16 recurring states</strong>. These range from simple, single-thread channels to complex, messy networks full of bars and islands.</p>
        <div class="figure-placeholder">[INSERT FIGURE 3.10 FROM THESIS]<br><span>The River’s Alphabet. These are the 16 recurring shapes (states) our algorithm discovered. They range from simple, narrow channels (Cluster 00) to wide, complex braided networks (Cluster 09).</span></div>
      </div>

      <div class="section-block">
        <h3>The “Traffic Light” Dynamics</h3>
        <p>This is where the theory gets exciting. Once we identified these states, we realized they didn't just look different—they <em>behaved</em> differently. We could map them onto a “map of dynamics” (a Markov Chain) that revealed three distinct regimes, which I like to call the <strong>Anchor</strong>, <strong>Transit</strong>, and <strong>Storage</strong> states.</p>
        <div class="figure-placeholder">[INSERT FIGURE 3.19 FROM THESIS]<br><span>The Heartbeat of the River. A dynamics map shows three functional groups: Anchors (long-lived, efficient), Transit (short-lived, highly active), and Storage (inefficient, sediment-storing).</span></div>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The “Anchors” (Red Group):</strong> Simple, single-thread states. They are rare, but when the river finds one, it “anchors” there for a long time. These states act like a firehose—they are efficient and transport massive amounts of sediment.</li>
          <li><strong>The “Storage” States (Blue Group):</strong> Wide, complex braided patterns. They are inefficient. When the river looks like this, it acts like a sponge, dissipating energy and storing sediment in bars rather than moving it downstream.</li>
          <li><strong>The “Transit” States (Green Group):</strong> Short-lived and highly active. They act as a bridge, allowing the river to quickly reorganize itself from a storage state to an active state.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="section-block">
        <h3>Forecasting by “Reading” the Water</h3>
        <p>By linking these shapes to the sediment data, we confirmed a powerful rule: <strong>Form dictates function.</strong></p>
        <div class="figure-placeholder">[INSERT FIGURE 3.12 FROM THESIS]<br><span>The Rule of Transport. As the river becomes more braided and complex (higher Entropic Braiding Index), sediment transport drops. Simple shapes move sediment; complex shapes store it.</span></div>
        <p>Using this rule, we built a probabilistic model (a generator) that can simulate thousands of possible futures for the river. Instead of calculating forces on particles, our model simply “walks” through the states—from Anchor, to Transit, to Storage—and predicts the sediment pulses associated with each step.</p>
        <p>The result? We successfully created a “digital twin” of the river’s behavior.</p>
        <div class="figure-placeholder">[INSERT FIGURE 4.2 FROM THESIS]<br><span>Reality vs. Simulation. The blue line is the actual sediment transport measured in the lab. The orange line is a synthetic timeline generated by our model, capturing the river’s “bursty” personality and extremes.</span></div>

      <div class="section-block">
        <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Remote Forecasting:</strong> In remote mountain regions where we cannot install sensors, we could estimate sediment hazards simply by analyzing satellite or drone imagery of the river’s shape.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Risk Management:</strong> By understanding the Transit states, we might be able to predict when a river is about to switch from a quiet “storage” phase to a dangerous “high transport” phase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We showed that beneath the chaos of a braided river, there is a structure. It is a system that speaks a language of states and transitions—and now, we know how to read it.</p>
