        <h3>Two viewpoints on the same hazard</h3>
        <p>
          By this stage, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>flow‑based estimate</strong> of the 100‑year peak discharge \(Q_{100}\) from extreme value analysis of the gauge record, and</li>
          <li>A <strong>rainfall‑based estimate</strong> obtained by running the calibrated rainfall–runoff model with a 100‑year design storm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Combining these viewpoints helps us check consistency and understand the sensitivity of our design values to modelling assumptions.
        </p>

        <h3>Comparing peaks and volumes</h3>
        <p>
          I compare:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The peak flows from both approaches,</li>
          <li>The associated flood volumes (area under each synthetic hydrograph), and</li>
          <li>The timing and shape of the hydrographs for different storm durations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In my workflow, discrepancies are treated as information. If the rainfall‑based estimate is systematically higher, it may indicate that the flow record does not yet contain a “true” 100‑year event, or that the rainfall representation is conservative. If it is lower, the catchment might be able to concentrate runoff more efficiently than the simple lumped model suggests.
