        <h3>Before we start</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Install:</strong> Python 3.11+, NumPy, Matplotlib; optional: Jupyter, git, VS Code (or your preferred IDE).</li>
          <li><strong>Prereqs:</strong> basics of shallow water equations, calculus and linear algebra, finite differences, and comfort with Python scripting.</li>
          <li><strong>Goal:</strong> a clean, minimal solver that hydraulic engineers can read, modify, and extend (sediment transport, source terms, parallelization, GPU, etc.). Think of it as a bridge between “black-box” models and the equations underneath.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What we will do in Week 1</h3>
        <p>This week is about setting the foundations: creating a simple, reproducible environment and writing down the shallow water equations we want to solve in 2D. We will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set up a minimal project structure (folders for code, notebooks, and figures).</li>
          <li>Decide on units, notation, and conventions for depth, velocity, and discharge.</li>
          <li>Write the conservative form of the shallow water equations and identify all terms we plan to include (and which we will postpone).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The actual code and notebooks for Week 1 will be pushed progressively to <a href="https://github.com/cgotelli/14-Weeks-to-SWE">the project repo</a> as the project advances.</p>
